# Special Thanks

A very special thanks goes out to [@Golan](https://twitter.com/golan) for inviting me out to his studio, [The STUDIO for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/) during the [Spring of 2019](https://www.flickr.com/photos/creativeinquiry/albums/72157703188612302). It was during this residency that I was encouraged to begin integrating Handsfree.js into different libraries and where I had a chance to use Handsfree.js with a real UR5 robot!

Another special thanks goes out to [@AnilDash](https://twitter.com/anildash) for sponsoring me during Winter 2018. Also a thank you to [The School of AI](https://twitter.com/SchoolOfAIOffic) for the [2018 Fellowship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDpF4xUieY&t=58). And a very special thanks to [Jess Holbrook](https://twitter.com/jessscon) from Google Pair for driving all the way (way) out to meet me and helping kickstart this all with a new computer!

Thanks also to everyone who's supported me on Patreon, GoFundMe, and through Twitter over the months (and almost years!). And thanks everyone else for believing in this project ðŸ‘‹
